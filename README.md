AI use disclosure: Claude was used to generate parts of this project. Some of the use-cases were:

- generate code blocks to do substitution, print conditions in the right order, etc
- suggest modifications given any unexpected outputs or errors in the program
- generate bash script to run both the reference implementaion and the project implemention and show comparision results in a nice UI
- generate comprehensive test cases for simple IMP programs
